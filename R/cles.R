#' Calculates the Common Language Effect Size (CLES)

#' @description
#' Calculates the Common Language Effect Size (CLES) for two variables. The CLES function converts the effect size to a probability that a unit/subject will have a larger measurement than another unit/subject. See [notebook](https://ercbk.github.io/Data-Science-Notebook/qmd/post-hoc-analysis-multilevel.html#common-language-effect-size) for further details.
#'
#' @param data dataframe; Data should be in long format
#' @param variable numeric vector; Variable of interest
#' @param group string; The name of group variable
#' @param baseline string; The name of the category of the group variable that's the control group or baseline in a repeated measure scenario.
#'
#' @return
#' The function returns a scalar value.
#'
#' @details
#' This measure is also referred to as the _Probability of Superiority_. The conversion of effect size to a probability or percentage is supposed to be easier for the laymen to interpret.
#' Interpretation:
#'    - Between-Subjects: The probability that a randomly sampled person from one group will have a higher observed measurement than a randomly sampled person from the other group.
#'    - Within-Subjects: The probability that an individual has a higher value on one measurement than the other.
#'
#' Formula:
#' \deqn{\tilde d = \frac{|M_1 - M_2|}{\sqrt{p_1\text{SD}_1^2 + p_2\text{SD}_2^2}}\\ Z = \frac{\tilde d}{\sqrt{2}}}
#'
#'    - \eqn{M_i}: The mean of the i<sup>th</sup> group
#'    - \eqn{p_i}: The proportion of the sample size of the i<sup>th</sup> group
#'    - \eqn{Z}: The z-score which is in turn used to produce the probability.
#'    - Same formula is used for both within and between designs
